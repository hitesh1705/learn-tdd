Getting 100% in test coveragemeans that all the lines of the code in the
applicationhas been executed at least once during testing. Also, it does
not mean all the edge cases and all possible scenarios are covered and
tested. It is important to write meaningful tests that cover different 
branches, error handling, and edge cases to ensure the robustness of your 
application. 100% coverage is a good, but the quality and relevance of the 
tests are also equally important.
